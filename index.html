        <h2>About Me</h2> 
        <p>What do you think of when you hear the word <em>leader?</em>
            Perhaps you think of a famous person in history, or perhaps someone
            that has left a positive impression on your life.</p>
      
        <p>A leader to me is a person that can has accepted the responsibity of being
            transparent and vunerable while at the same time guiding others to success. 
            A leader has made mistakes but has not failed.</p>
      
        <p>I have had the opportunity to do a lot of things in life that I have enjoyed, 
            yet never was where I was supposed to be.
            Many people would say that I am a lost soul. As a matter of fact, they have.</p>

        <p>Nah, I am a <em>leader.</em></p>
   
        <p>So, lets get personal...born Jessica Amanda I quickly learned that no matter how
        easy your name is-people will always try and change it. So, I decided around adolenence
        that 'Jess' and 'Jessie' were not my favorite names for me. It was baffling that 'Jessica' was just too much 
        say. Lord knows, I wouldn't want to trouble anyone by reciting a three syllable name.</P>
    

        <p> I had to think what was easy but it didn't sound embarrasing at the same time. Then it happened!
        While switching classes in 10th grade; I heard an upper classman basketball player yell from the other side of 
        the large rotunda yelling 'J'. Well,
        he actually said "hey I know you...you are...something with a J, right?" I decided
        to forget the fact he did not really know me outside of the boy I called myself dating at the 
        time.<p>
  
       <p>There it was, a new creation and new identity, easy, chic, and unforgettable.
        Long story short. My name is Jessica Amanda. I go by Jai</p>
        <p>I am a southern girl with upstate vibe. I enjoy being 
        creative and writing because it fuels my soul and empowers others. I have worked 
        in the corporate world, I have taught, I have counseled etc. I laugh at my jokes even 
        when no one else does. Don't really care either. I believe that a 
        life filled with variety is a fulfilling one. I really enjoy chocolate ice cream
        and pasta. Not together, but <em>definately</em> on the same day!</p>
     <p>Lastly, but most imprtantly, my heart grooves to four perfect verses over
        a tight beat. My family.</p>
        <p>Okay, enough about me and all the sappy stuff. Go look around the site!</p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
         <p>Jai</p>
