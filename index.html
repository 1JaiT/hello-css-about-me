<body><h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        What do you think of when you hear the word <em>leader?</em>
        Perhaps you think of a famous person in history, or perhaps someone
        that has left a positive impression on your life.
    </p>
    <p>
        A leader to me is a person that can has accepted the responsibity of being
        transparent and vunerable while at the same time guiding others to success. 
        A leader has made mistakes but has not failed.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have had the opportunity to do a lot of things in life that I have enjoyed, 
        yet never was where I was supposed to be.
        Many people would say that I am a lost soul. As a matter of fact, they have.
    </p>  
     <p>   
        Nah, I am a <em>leader.</em>
    </p>

    <p>

        So, lets get personal...born Jessica Amanda I quickly learned that no matter how
        easy your name is-people will always try and change it. So, I decided around adolenence
        that 'Jess' and 'Jessie' were not my favorite names for me. It was baffling that 'Jessica' was just too much 
        say. Lord knows, I wouldn't want to trouble anyone by reciting a three syllable name. 
    </P>
    
    <p>

         I had to think what was easy but it didn't sound embarrasing at the same time. Then it happened!
        While switching classes in 10th grade; I heard an upper classman basketball player yell from the other side of 
        the large rotunda yelling 'J'. Well,
        he actually said "hey I know you...you are...something with a J, right?" I decided
        to forget the fact he did not really know me outside of the boy I called myself dating at the 
        time. 
     <p>   
        There it was, a new creation and new identity, easy, chic, and unforgettable.
        Long story short. My name is Jessica Amanda. I go by Jai.

    <p>
        I am a southern girl with upstate vibe. I enjoy being 
        creative and writing because it fuels my soul and empowers others. I have worked 
        in the corporate world, I have taught, I have counseled etc. I laugh at my jokes even 
        when no one else does. Don't really care either. I believe that a 
        life filled with variety is a fulfilling one. I really enjoy chocolate ice cream
        and pasta. Not together, but <em>definately</em> on the same day! 
    </p>
     <p>   Lastly, but most imprtantly, my heart grooves to four perfect verses over
        a tight beat. My family.
    </p>

        Okay, enough about me and all the sappy stuff. Go look around the site!
    <p>
        Enjoy!
